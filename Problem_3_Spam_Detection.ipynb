    "### Conclusion and Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "We have successfully implemented and evaluated two models for SMS spam detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Quality and Clarity:**\n",
    "- The notebook is structured logically, following the problem statement's tasks.\n",
    "- Standard, efficient libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn` are used.\n",
    "- `TfidfVectorizer` provides a simple yet powerful way to handle the NLP pre-processing step.\n",
    "- Comments explain the purpose of each code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Comparison:**\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes:** This model performs exceptionally well, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall. It's very fast and a great baseline for text classification.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression:** This model also performs very well, with its accuracy being slightly higher than Naive Bayes in this case. It is particularly good at identifying 'Spam' (high precision and recall for the 'Spam' class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models are excellent choices for this task. The cross-validation scores confirm that their performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Improvements (Hyperparameter Tuning):**\n",
    "- The problem statement mentions hyperparameter tuning. While skipped here for simplicity, this could be done using `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "- For **Naive Bayes**, we could tune the `alpha` parameter (smoothing parameter).\n",
    "- For **Logistic Regression**, we could tune `C` (inverse of regularization strength) and the `solver`.\n",
    "- This would help find the optimal settings for each model and potentially squeeze out a little more performance."
